### Guide (step-by-step)
 * To create a new account, head on to <a href="https://app.lepsta.com/auth/signup" target="_blank">lepsta.com</a>.
 * Alternatively, Lepsta lets you setup your account using third party authentication providers like Google, GitHub and Bitbucket.

To ensure that you have captured your details correctly, you will be asked to verify your email address after signing up for a new account. Please check your email, also check your spam box if it doesnt appear on your primary inbox.

!!! note "Note"
    Authorising your development computers to access your Lepsta Platform account still requires that you set up a password. So, even if you sign up with an OAuth service provider, you will be asked to set up a password, even though this might change in the future.



Congratulations, you have successfully created a new Lepsta account.
