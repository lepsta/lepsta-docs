# How to work with streams

## Introduction
A stream is a replicated sandbox that can contain file changes and other related information. Just like a branch, a stream in the repository is represented as a reference that points at a specific revision in the repository. [Learn more](docs/pages/references/concepts/stream.md)...

## Requirements
  + A Lepsta account.
  + Basic Knowledge of the command line.
 

## Concepts
* [Repository](docs/pages/references/concepts/repository.md).
* [Stream](docs/pages/references/concepts/stream.md).
 

## Guide (step-by-step)

1.  To create a new stream, navigate to the `work` tab, this is where the whole team can organise the work they intend to do. 
2.  Click the `New Stream` button to add your first stream.
3.  Give your stream a name and provide more description about what the stream is about.
4.  Assign your stream to a team member or yourself.

### Stream stream status
 When you are ready to start working you can change the status to one of the following:
 
```title="Created"
Newly created streams  are organised under the this status.
```

```title="Mark started"
This status is mainly for non coding tasks. You can use these status for tasks such as design and research tasks
```

```title="Start coding"
When you select this option it means you want to write code, therefore, ensure that you have attached a repository.
```

```title="Review"
The review status indicates work done that needs a formal assessment, 
with the intention of instituting change if necessary. 
```

```title="Done"
Changing the status to done it means your work has been reviewed and you are happy mark it as completed. Coding streams will be automatically moved here when the stream is closed and commited. 
```
