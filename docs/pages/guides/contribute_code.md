# Introduction (should outline the problem/task)

The end goal of using Lepsta is to contribute code, and Lepsta aims to help development teams do so collaboratively and efficiently with minimum code conflicts,misunderstanding and loss of code imposed by human error.

## Requirements
To start contributing code ensure the following is checked:

1. You must have a Lepsta account
2. You must have created and mounted your repository
3. Have your streams created
4. You have downloaded and logged in on the Lepsta Desktop app
5. You must have someone to collaborate with (recommended but optional)

If you check all the above then you can continue reading this article, if not, please refer to the[getting started manual](pages/tutorials/getting_started.md) for a tutorial that will take you from setting up your account to getting activated.

## Concepts


## Guide (step-by-step)

### Pre-steps
1. Log in to your Lepsta account
2. Create a new empty Lepsta repository or import an existing Git repository
3. Create a stream/s of the work you want to accomplish
4. Attach a repository to the stream you are planning to work on
5. On the stream, click on the circle as shown below

6. Click on ``start coding`` 
7. Click on ``edit code locally``. This will trigger Uju to switch to this stream locally

### Contribute code
Once you have done the above you can now open the Lepsta Desktop app and search for your repository

1. Click on ``open`` with Visual Studio Code
2. At this point you should start contributing code

if you see your changes reflecting on the Platform online it means you can successfully contributed code. But it doesn't end here, as a code contributor you are required to:

### Get your code reviewed or you can reviewed

First change your stream review status to ``Review``. Now that you have contributed your code, it is best to get your team to review your work to avoid rework. Go ahead and invite code reviewers and hear what they got to say:

Your fellow collaborators will comment directly on your lines of code and you can reply and have a discussion thread. They can click on ``Looks good`` to finalise their reviews. When you are happy with their input you can then resolve the comments.  



## Reflection
If your code reflects on the Platform then this guide was successful.
