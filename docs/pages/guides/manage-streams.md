# Manage streams

## Introduction
A stream is a replicated sandbox that can contain file changes and other related information. Just like a branch, a stream in the repository is represented as a reference that points at a specific revision in the repository. [Learn more](docs/pages/references/concepts/stream.md)...

## Create a new stream
To create a new stream, navigate to the ``work`` tab, this is where the whole team can organise the work they intend to do. 

1.  Click the ``New Stream`` button to add your first stream
2.  Give your stream a name and provide more description about what the stream is about and click `Add stream`

!!! note "streams are for everyone"
    Everyone can manage their work using stream, including non-techinical people. Coding streams will be linked to a repository while, other streams can be treated as normal tasks with no repository attached to them.

You will notice that create repositories they get organised under the "Created" status. When you are ready to start working you can change the status of the stream.
