You can have two types of workspaces, a ``personal workspace`` which is created by default upon signup. You cannot collaborate on this workspace, every repository on this workspace is only visible to you.

You can also create a ``team workspace`` which allows you to invite people you wish to collaborate with on aproject. This is a shared workspace which means all reposoritories and contributions are visible to everyone.

This image depicts a list of workspaces and how to create a new one:

To create a team workspace, navigate to the top right hand corner of the screen and click on the ``Create+`` button.
Start by giving your workspace a unique name, add an avatar and click the create workspace button.

 Any [Stream](/pages/lepsta/manage-streams) and [Repository](/pages/lepsta/manage-repositories) that you create will be share with your collaborators.
