# Creating a repository

## Introduction
A workspace could be regarded as a project or an organisation. This is where you and your fellow developers collaborate on a project. 

## Concepts
[What is Lepsta](docs/pages/lepsta/how-lepsta-works.md)

## Requirements
* A Lepsta account

## Step-by-step Guide
There are two types of spaces that you have access to:

`Personal workspace` is created by default upon signup. You cannot collaborate on this workspace, every repository on this workspace is only visible to you.

`Team workspace`  allow you to invite people that you want to collaborate with on a project. This is a shared workspace which means all repositories and contributions are visible to everyone.

This image depicts a list of workspaces and how to create a new one:

1. To create a team workspace, navigate to the top right corner of the screen and click on the `Create+` button.
2. Give your workspace a unique name, add an avatar and then click the create workspace button.
