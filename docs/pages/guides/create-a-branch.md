# Creating a branch



## Create a repository
In your workspace, navigate to ``repositories`` to create a new repository.

You will notice that you have some options to choose from. You can either import your existing repository from Github or Bitbucket or you can create an empty repository to start on a clean slate. Give your repository a name and get ready for the next steps.

## Mount a repository
Congratulations on creating your shiny first Lepsta repository. Now you have to mount it locally so that you can contribute code to it. In order to do that however, you must install Uju to your machine first.

Notice (on the image above) that you have to choose a device where you want Uju to be installed. This could be another device at work, at home or even a server sitting  elsewhere.
