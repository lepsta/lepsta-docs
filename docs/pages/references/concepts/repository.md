# :octicons-repo-24: Repository

## Introduction
A repository is a data store that keeps track of file metadata and content. It is used by a version control tool to manage changes to files. On Lepsta, a repository is managed by a program called Uju. Uju is a version control server whose aim is to maintain a consistent state of the files across different machines.

## Why is it useful?
In software development, as is the case in other collaborative setups, it is important to have a system of accepting contributions from different users. In addition, it's also super important to maintain the history of changes such that previous states of the software can be produced. This is where repositories come in.

## How to use it?
Repositories can be created and managed using the Lepsta Platform. Typically, they are mounted on a developer's machine where they write the code. See the relevant guide for more details on how to use a repository.

## Related concepts
Repositories can be complex, and sometimes they need to be, to enable the features that are required. Following are some of the concepts that are useful to understand if you are going to work with repositories:

 - [Branch](/pages/references/concepts/branch)
 - [Stream](/pages/references/concepts/stream)
 - [Commit](/pages/references/concepts/commit)
 - [Changeset](/pages/references/concepts/changeset)
