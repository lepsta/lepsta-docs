## What are streams?

Streams are simply 'Work Items'. A stream is work (tasks) created for immediate action for collaboration purposes. 
It is used to plan, organize, and collaborate on any project. Streams can be created in a personal or team workspace.

Streams can be associated with a repository or isolated on it's own. It is is visibility to see what others are working on.


## How streams work?

Streams represent a continuous flow of data towards a specific goal. This could be source code, comments, attachments etc. 
contributed to achieve goal such as completing a task, implementing a bug fix, or software feature and more.

To contribute source code, a stream can be linked to a repository. This process generates a stream reference in the repository 
that automatically indexes and replicate code changes made while it's active. These changes propagate into the stream in realtime.
